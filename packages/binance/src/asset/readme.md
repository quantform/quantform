# Assets

Binance assets are represented by ticker symbols, which are standardized codes used to identify specific assets on the exchange. These ticker symbols are used in trading pairs, which represent the exchange rate between two assets. For example, the trading pair BTC/USDT represents the exchange rate between Bitcoin and Tether, a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar.
